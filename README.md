# Overview

## About Inventory

The Inventory app is a solution for your disorganized asset collection. With an inventory combined with the help of RFID technology, it'll be easy to track the location and availability of your items, prevent them from missing, or find them when needed.

**This is currently a personal hobby project.**

The Inventory project was created after going through a series of stressful house moves. Originally, it aimed to solve the problems of a nomadic lifestyle where everything doesn't have a fixed place, making it hard to manage and locate items.

### **Why Inventory**

The Inventory app is designed to address specific challenges in managing and tracking assets in both personal and professional settings. Here are some of the practical reasons to consider using Inventory:

* **Efficiency in Locating Items**: If you cannot find an item in minutes, it's akin to not having it at all. With Inventory, you can log the location of an item in the app. The next time you need it, use a full-text search to find the item and view its last logged location, turning a potentially lengthy lookup into a quick, effortless task.
* **Item Tracking with RFID**: Searching for misplaced items can be frustrating and time-consuming. Inventory uses RFID technology to quickly locate your items, saving valuable time and reducing stress. Additionally, RFID can be used to log the current location of an item, simplifying the process of updating its whereabouts for future reference.
* **Proactive Stock Management**: Inventory isn't just about knowing where items are; it's also about understanding what you have. The app can also track stock levels, letting you know what items that need restocking. Keeping track of your inventory can help you avoid making unnecessary purchases by reminding you of what you already have in stock.
* **Asset Loss Prevention**: Whether you're a frequent traveler or need to account for company assets after a day out in the field, Inventory can prevent loss during transit from leaving a site. The rapid scanning capabilities afforded by RFID mean that checking off items from a list is no longer a painstaking task but a quick and reliable operation. With just a sweep of an RFID reader, you can be assured that nothing is left behind.
* **Never Forget a Thing**: Whether you're a professional working on-site or an outdoor enthusiast heading for an adventure, having the right tools and equipment on hand is vital. Inventory ensures you're prepared for these scenarios with smart checklists - whether it's ensuring that you have at least one tape measure in your toolbox, the correct chargers for your devices, or all the gear for your outdoor adventure, letting you confidently begin your journey.

While there are a variety of tools for asset management, Inventory stands out due to several key factors that make it exceptionally useful for managing assets within a home or a small business setting.

* **Source-Available** - Inventory's codebase is openly accessible. You're empowered to modify the app, add features as needed, or integrate it with other systems. The open nature of the source code also encourages a community-driven development process, where feedback and collaborative improvements enrich the app's functionality. Moreover, with a source-available approach, you can use Inventory with confidence, knowing that the continuity of the software can be in your control, not dependent on the whims of a vendor.
* **You Own Your Data** - With Inventory, the ownership and control of your data remain in your hands. The opened CouchDB API and CouchDB Replication Protocol make it feasible for you to migrate or integrate with other software or tools. Additionaly, the ability to self-host your data not only provides an extra layer of security but also is essential for maintaining your operational independence and data sovereignty, allowing you to adapt as your business or personal needs evolve.
* **Design** - Emphasizing user experience, Inventory adheres to the design guidelines of iOS and Android platforms, ensuring a familiar and intuitive user experience that meshes well with your existing devices. The app aims not just to be aesthetically pleasing but also to be user-friendly, making asset management easy at your fingertips.
