## Overview

The Inventory app is a solution for your disorganized asset collection. With an inventory combined with the help of RFID technology, it'll be easy to track the location and availability of your items, prevent them from missing, or find them when needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**This is currently a personal hobby project.**

The Inventory project was created after going through a series of stressful house moves. Originally, it aimed to solve the problems of a nomadic lifestyle where everything doesn't have a fixed place, making it hard to manage and locate items.

Before investing in your RFID-tracked inventory, be sure that you're aware of the [known limitations](overview/features.md#known-limitiations). See the [price estimation](rfid-hardware/price-estimation.md) to have an idea of how much it'll cost.
