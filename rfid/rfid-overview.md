## Known Limitations

### RFID Tag Limitations

Itâ€™s essential to be cognizant of the limitations associated with UHF RFID tags and metal or liquid environments. Standard RFID tags may not function optimally on metal surfaces or liquid-containing containers due to signal reflection or absorption. Specialized anti-metal tags are available for these scenarios, though they come at a premium. Additionally, the effective read range of RFID tags can diminish significantly if obscured by metal, and tags housed within fully enclosed metal containers will be unreadable.
