# Different Kinds of RFID Tags

There are a variety of RFID UHF tags available on the market, each designed for specific use cases and environments.

## Sticker Tags

Being the most common kind of RFID tags, these tags are cost-effective and can often cost around or less than US$ 0.1 per piece.

### Transparent Sticker Tags

So-called "wet-inlay," These adhesive tags are created to stick onto any flat surface and are resistant to water splashes and alcohol sprays. They come in various sizes, enabling you to select the one that best suits your item.

### Paper Sticker Tags

With a printable surface, item information such as the name, asset ID, storage unit, barcodes, or QR codes can be printed on the tag using a thermal-transfer label printer, making it easier to identify the item or to scan the tag to access more information or for management. They come in various sizes, enabling you to select the one that best suits your item.

The most common types of paper layers for tags are coated paper or synthetic paper. When using tags with a synthetic paper layer and a suitable carbon ribbon, the tag can resist water splashes and alcohol wipes.

**It is recommended to wipe the surface with alcohol before sticking RFID tags onto it**

Slip additives are often used during the production of plastic products to decrease friction and prevent sticking. However, these additives can interfere with the tags' ability to stick properly. Alcohol can be used to remove any leftover slip additives, particularly on zipper bags.

## On-Metal RFID Tags

While standard RFID tags cannot function properly when attached to metal surfaces, these specialized tags, often called "On-Metal RFID Tags" or "Anti-Metal RFID Tags," are designed to work effectively in such conditions.

While being able to work near metal or liquid, on-metal RFID tags often come with a higher price tag compared to regular RFID tags.

### Flexible On-Metal RFID Tags

These tags resemble [paper sticker tags](different-kinds-of-rfid-tags.md#paper-sticker-tags) in appearance and functionality but are much thicker. They contain special layers that allow the tag to operate normally when attached to metal surfaces.

They are ideal for items where traditional sticker tags fail to work due to metal or liquid interference.

### Hard PCB RFID Tags

These tags are durable and made of rigid PCB material.

There are attachment methods to choose from, allowing you to tailor them according to your specific needs:

* **Screws**: Many Hard PCB RFID Tags come with pre-drilled holes, making them easy to attach directly to the asset with screws.\

* **VHB Tape**: A versatile and quick solution for smooth, non-porous surfaces. VHB (Very High Bond) tape is a strong adhesive that ensures a firm hold. This method is suitable for assets where drilling is not possible or desirable and for environments where a quick, clean attachment is needed.\

* **Heat-Shrinking Tubes:** When it comes to items that cannot be screwed or lack a flat or stickable surface, heat-shrinking tubes present an effective method to attach RFID tags to any portion of an item that can be encased with these tubes. Heat-shrinking tubes can also be used to reinforce VHB tape or screw-attached RFID tags, smoothing the edges of the applied tags, reducing the likelihood of detachment, or enhancing their appearance.\

### Cable Tags <a href="#rfid-uhf-cable-tag" id="rfid-uhf-cable-tag"></a>

While commonly used as jewelry tags in retail, these tags are also a great choice for tagging cables. When using cable tags made of PVC or synthetic paper together with a suitable carbon ribbon, the tag can withstand water splashes and alcohol wipes.
